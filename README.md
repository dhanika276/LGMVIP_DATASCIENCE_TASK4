# LGMVIP_DATASCIENCE_TASK4
Developing a Image to Pencil Sketch with Python. To programmatically transform a color image into a black and white pencil sketch with enhanced details, we first read the image in RGB format. Convert the image to grayscale, removing color information. Then create an inverted grayscale image by reversing the intensity values.Blend the grayscale and inverted blurry images by dividing corresponding pixel values. The resulting image will resemble a pencil sketch.
